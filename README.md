# Connect-4-Naveen-Bhatti
## Description
This project creates a connect-4 game that allows for two-players to play. The game uses an array of solutions to compare user placements of their pieces to compute the winner of the game. The game has conditions for each players win as well as a tie.
### Background
This project was made within the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly with the goal to create a browser-based game to showcase the skills learned throughout the first unit.
## Getting Started
The game can be played [here](https://connect4naveen.netlify.app). The game is played similarly to Connect-4 in real life, but there is a slight change.
1. Selecting a piece/slot will cause a piece to drop to the lowest place in the column.
2. Once you "connect 4", you will be presented with a win message and an option to reset using the button below the board.
