# Connect-4-Naveen-Bhatti
## Description
This project creates a connect-4 game that allows for two-players to play. The game uses an array of solutions to compare user placements of their pieces to compute the winner of the game. The game has conditions for each players win as well as a tie.
### Background
This project was made within the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly with the goal to create a browser-based game to showcase the skills learned throughout the first unit.
## Getting Started
The game can be played [here](https://connect4naveen.netlify.app). The game is played similarly to Connect-4 in real life, but there is a slight change.
1. Selecting a piece/slot will cause a piece to drop to the lowest place in the column.
2. Once you "connect 4", you will be presented with a win message and an option to reset using the button below the board.

## Technologies Used
Within this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Below are basic summaries of how each technology was used:
- HTML: HTML was used to create the basic elements on the page such as the tiles, headings, and game board.
- CSS: CSS was used to create the styling and animations of the game elements such as the backgrounds, heading styling, and grid/flexbox.
- Javascript: Javascript was used to script the various functions for the actual game play as well as setting some of the styling elements dynamically.

## Future Enhancements
As for future enhancements, I have a few that are listed below.
- Change Play Dynamics: Remove the event listeners from the board to above the board, as well as add a hover over each column to display a semi-transparent game piece. This would better emulate a user holding a piece over the game board and dropping it.
- Art: Improving the art would also be a desired enhancement. The background is my primary concern as the game pieces were styled to look like the originals; however, the board should also be modified.
